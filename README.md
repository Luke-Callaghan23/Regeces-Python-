# Regeces-Python-
This is another Regex engine, this time written in Python.

I wrote this version of the regex engine before I wrote the one I wrote in C.  Similarly to how I wrote the C engine to give myself a stress
test of my skills in C, I also wrote this engine as a way to test my skills in Python shortly after I learned the language.


(You may also notice that this file is 1000 lines long to implement an entire regex engine in Python, but the C version is split into many files
with multiple of those being larger than 1000 lines.  If there is any testament to how powerful Python is as a scripting language, it should be
this.)
